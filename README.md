## Welcome to my profile

I'm an ex Web2 penetration tester and ex cloud security engineer (for a CEX, which is how I got into crypto). I love all things security, development and recently fell in love with SUI Move. I feel like this is where I want to make my mark! I'm currently looking for bugs in the wild and buidling a dex with a mate to "learn by building". I also audit ETH protocols for food... üçø
